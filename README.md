Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hi, I'm Shaun Rolph!

I am passionate about data science, Tableau dashboarding, and creating innovative solutions to tackle large-scale challenges. This GitHub repository serves as my portfolio to showcase my projects, research, code, and visualizations.

My professional experience spans roles in data science, analytics, and financial management, where I’ve developed solutions for complex problems in government, international development, and private sectors. I specialize in building dynamic dashboards, creating machine learning models, and leveraging tools like Python, Tableau, and SQL to drive insights and inform decision-making. I’m constantly learning new technologies and techniques to enhance my skill set and deliver impactful results.


Feel free to explore my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or would like to collaborate!
